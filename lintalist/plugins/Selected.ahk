/*

comment: because it should now be able to process nested plugins better this plugin label
can be executed several times in a row and thus execute the "copy selected text" multiple
times as well. Therefore instead of using ^x to CUT the text to the clipboard ^c is used 
to COPY it instead - otherwise multiple CUT routines might be executed in succession which
could result in:
- empty selection being cut (selected text was already cut, so there would be nothing to cut again)
- "eating up" all text in the document (depending on editor), with each cut the "caret"
  is moved up a line so the next cycle would cut that line as well and so on...
