Automates Instagram by taking jobs from a google spreadsheet and performing actions on instagram. It uses autohokey to simulate a human using a browser.
It can post photos, as well as crop photos to specified dimensions and engage in a limited way by commenting, liking and following.

The project has been abandonend due to Facebook making Instagram a private service and removing public access. I stopped publishing and using Instagram when they made everyones public photos their private property.
